        Exercise 3 (50P):
        a) Create a class Hiker which contains information about a hiking Java student
        The class has the following properties:
        - Strings: name, hikingArea, country,
        - int: weight (in kilograms), height (in centimeters), age (in years)
        - boolean: isFemale
        - Collection of FoodItems: rucksack
        - FoodItem: favouriteFood

        All properties must be readable with getter methods!
        If you need to extend the list above: feel free! In this case no getters (or setters) shall be implemented.

        Constructing an object must be possible without parameters.
        (Strings shall be empty then, ints shall be 0, booleans shall be false, rucksack and favouriteFood shall be null)
        There should also be a way to create a hiker object by providing name, hikingArea and country plus a maximum item
        capacity (int) of the rucksack (we'll come back to that later - you don't need to do anything with this value here,
         just keep it in mind). The property country shall always be converted to uppercase letters.

        The output shall print name, hikingArea, country and favouriteFood in separate lines. If any of the elements is
        empty no blank line shall appear.
        You don't need to care for the output of foodItems - just print them as they are.

        When creating a hiker with the second way of a) we provided a maximumCapacity of the rucksack. Implement a way
        to initialize the (internal) rucksack of the hiker with exactly the right number of foodItems.
        - Encapsulate this behaviour to hide it form the world outside the object.
        - init the rucksack only with favouriteFood elements - we don't need perfectly evened nutrition üòâ

        - female hikers: 10 * body weight (kg) + 6.25 * height (cm) - 5 * age (years) - 161
